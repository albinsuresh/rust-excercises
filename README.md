Excercises to improve your Rust skills

## Approach

For each individual exercise (e.g. `ex-001`), open a PR to my repo that
contains your solutions in the code. For those assignments that requires a
textual answer (e.g. Assignment 0 of `ex-001`), write your answer directly into
the `README.md` (`ex-001/README.md`) right after the question.
